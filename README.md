🧠 VeriCortex
Trust Layer for AI — Verifiable Intelligence on BlockDAG
VeriCortex is a modular AI verification and trust framework designed to run on BlockDAG networks.
It enables applications to prove AI outputs, secure autonomous agents, and build verifiable compute pipelines.

We bring cryptographic trust to AI by validating computation proofs, inference attestations, and execution integrity signals.

Whether AI is running locally, in a cloud, in a smart agent swarm, or on a decentralized compute network — VeriCortex allows users to verify what really happened, not just trust claims.

🎯 Mission
To make AI provable, trustworthy, and censorship-resistant — enabling secure autonomous systems and transparent on-chain intelligence.
