## 🧠 VeriCortex  
**Trust Layer for AI — Verifiable Intelligence on BlockDAG**

veriCortex is a **modular AI verification and trust framework** designed to run on **BlockDAG** networks.  
It enables applications to **prove AI outputs**, **secure autonomous agents**, and **build verifiable compute pipelines**.

We bring **cryptographic trust to AI** by validating computation proofs, inference attestations, and execution integrity signals.

Whether AI is running locally, in the cloud, within smart agent swarms, or across decentralized compute networks —  
**VeriCortex allows users to verify what really happened, not just trust claims.**

## 🎯 Mission
To make **AI provable, trustworthy, and censorship-resistant** — enabling secure autonomous systems and transparent on-chain intelligence.

## 🛠️ Overview
veriCortex bridges **AI computation** and **decentralized trust layers** by providing:
- Proofs of AI inference integrity  
- Verifiable execution across distributed nodes  
- Compatibility with cryptographic proof systems and attestations  
- Extensible adaptors for on-chain and off-chain environments  

---

## 🌐 Vision
To empower a new generation of **provable AI systems** where:
- Outputs can be **verified** instead of **assumed**  
- AI agents are **accountable**, **transparent**, and **trust-minimized**  
- The infrastructure for intelligence is **open**, **secure**, and **censorship-resistant**
