## ProofCortex – Verifiable AI for BlockDAG and Beyond

> **⚠️ Project Notice:**
> This project is being renamed to **ProofCortex**. At few places ProofCortex and VeriCortex names may have been used interchangebly.

ProofCortex is a modular AI verification and trust framework designed to run first
on BlockDAG networks. It enables applications to prove AI outputs, secure
autonomous agents, and build verifiable compute pipelines.

We bring cryptographic trust to AI by validating computation proofs, inference
attestations, and execution integrity signals. Whether AI is running locally,
in the cloud, within smart agent swarms, or across decentralized compute
networks — ProofCortex allows users to verify what really happened, not just
trust claims.

ProofCortex transforms AI systems from "trust-based" to "proof-based" by
providing a universal verification layer. It anchors model integrity, proves
inference correctness, and validates execution traces using lightweight
cryptographic proofs. This gives enterprises, regulators, and developers a
reliable way to trust AI outputs — even when models, data, or compute
environments are opaque.

By enabling verifiable AI pipelines, ProofCortex becomes foundational trust
infrastructure for the next generation of decentralized systems, autonomous
agents, and high-assurance AI applications.

## Who ProofCortex Is For

ProofCortex is designed for teams and ecosystems that rely on **trust, auditability, and transparency in AI**:

- **AI/ML Product Teams** – needing verifiable, deterministic model outputs for deployment and compliance.  
- **Enterprises & Regulated Sectors** – BFSI, healthcare, insurance, telecom, and government systems requiring auditable AI decisions.  
- **Web3 dApps & Agent Frameworks** – integrating AI inference with on-chain proof verification for trustless automation.  
- **Security, Risk & Compliance Teams** – validating AI pipeline integrity, preventing tampering, and ensuring traceability.  
- **Platform & Tooling Builders** – creating SDKs, agent systems, or inference platforms that require interoperable verification rails.

## Why BlockDAG for ProofCortex?

Traditional blockchains are sequential — every block must wait for the previous one to finalize.  
This linear structure introduces **latency**, **bottlenecks**, and **limited parallelism**, making them unsuitable for **real-time AI verification** and **distributed inference proofs**.

**BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph-based architecture)** changes that.

---

### Why it’s the perfect foundation for ProofCortex

| **Challenge** | **How BlockDAG Solves It** | **Impact on ProofCortex** |
|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Sequential validation in L1 chains** | Parallel block propagation and DAG-based finality | Enables high-throughput proof verification |
| **Limited concurrency for proof submissions** | DAG allows multiple proofs to be appended asynchronously | Many models or nodes can submit proofs in real-time |
| **Network latency during validation** | Blocks don’t compete for a single head — they co-exist | Reduces latency for inference confirmations |
| **Scalability constraints** | BlockDAG scales horizontally with node count | Supports massive AI inference traffic |
| **Security-trust gap for off-chain AI** | DAG topology maintains verifiable ordering of computation | Guarantees integrity between inference & proof submission |

---

### In ProofCortex Context

In the **ProofCortex ecosystem**, BlockDAG acts as the **trust backbone** for the Proof-of-Inference (PoI) layer:

1. **Off-chain runtimes** (WASM warm pools) execute AI inference deterministically.  
2. **Proofs** of these inferences (e.g., ZK or crypto attestations) are generated.  
3. **Verifier nodes** anchored on the BlockDAG validate and timestamp these proofs in parallel.  
4. Multiple verifiers can commit results without waiting on a single chain head — ensuring real-time trust for decentralized AI.

ProofCortex doesn’t just record computation — it *proves* it.  
BlockDAG provides the **parallel, verifiable, and low-latency substrate** needed to make proof-based AI verifiable **at scale**.

> **In essence:**  
> 🕸️ **BlockDAG = Proof Infrastructure for the AI Age.**

## Architecture Outline

The **ProofCortex architecture** is designed to bridge the gap between *AI inference* and *on-chain verifiability*.  
It leverages a **modular, scalable pipeline** that ensures deterministic execution, trace generation, and proof verification — all anchored on the **BlockDAG network**.

The architecture can be viewed in three main layers:

### 1. Off-Chain AI Runtime
- Executes inference tasks deterministically using WASM-based isolated environments.
- Captures execution traces and generates cryptographic or ZK proofs of correctness.
- Interfaces with the ProofCortex API for job orchestration and proof submission.

### 2. Verification Layer (On-Chain)
- Receives proofs from off-chain nodes and validates them via verifier smart agents.
- Anchors results onto the BlockDAG ledger, maintaining causal ordering.
- Supports concurrent submissions, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

### 3. Access & Integration Layer
- Provides APIs, SDKs, and dashboard explorers for dApps, agents, and model registries.
- Enables seamless integration into decentralized applications or data markets.
- Displays verified inference activity in real-time through the Explorer interface.
