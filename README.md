🧠 VeriCortex
Trust Layer for AI — Verifiable Intelligence on BlockDAG

VeriCortex is a modular AI verification and trust framework designed to run on BlockDAG networks.
It enables applications to prove AI outputs, secure autonomous agents, and build verifiable compute pipelines.

We bring cryptographic trust to AI by validating computation proofs, inference attestations, and execution integrity signals.

Whether AI is running locally, in a cloud, in a smart agent swarm, or on a decentralized compute network — VeriCortex allows users to verify what really happened, not just trust claims.

🎯 Mission

To make AI provable, trustworthy, and censorship-resistant — enabling secure autonomous systems and transparent on-chain intelligence.

🧩 Key Concepts
Concept	Description
Verifiable AI	Confirm AI outputs are correct & untampered
AI Proof Layer	Verify proofs of execution & inference integrity
On-chain Verifier	Minimal smart-contract verifier on BlockDAG
Off-chain Runtime	Secure WASM execution & proof pipeline
Proof Adaptors	Supports cryptographic proofs & attestations
⚙️ What VeriCortex Does

✅ Accepts attested AI inference results
✅ Verifies proofs or execution logs on-chain
✅ Bridges trust between AI agents ↔ blockchain apps
✅ Modular pipeline for different proof formats

🚀 Why It Matters

Modern AI systems cannot be blindly trusted.
VeriCortex enables:

Trustable AI agents

Cross-chain AI verifiers

Transparent and auditable pipelines

Fraud-proof inference for Web3 and enterprise
